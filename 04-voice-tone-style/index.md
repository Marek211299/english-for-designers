## Tone

I like to talk in a relaxed and easy-going way that fits in most places. My words are like a chat with a friend, which makes me sound real and honest. I use short forms, slang, and everyday words to sound friendly and easy to talk to. I don’t mind if I break some grammar rules if it makes my talk flow better and show my feelings more.
I like to show my feelings when I talk. I change the way I talk, how high or low my voice is, and how loud I am to show how I feel. I also use smiley faces, exclamation marks, and other punctuation to make my feelings stronger. I don’t hide how I feel, I share it with others.
I talk in a confident and strong way that shows I know what I’m talking about. I use clear and simple words that get my point across well and make people believe me. I also use real facts, proof, and examples to back up what I say. I don’t doubt myself or sound unsure, I talk with belief and control.

## Style

I use smiley faces to make my text more fun and show who I am. I use them to show how I feel, what I think, and what I believe. I also use them to make my text more exciting and interesting. I don’t use them all the time, but I use them in a smart and right way.
My texts are not very organized or official. I write in a relaxed and on-the-spot way to show who I am and how I talk. I don’t follow strict rules of how to organize my text or grammar, but I use my own way and what I like. I also use short forms, first letters of words, and signs to make my text shorter and easier to read.

## Voice

I like talking to people and making them feel good. I talk in a happy and excited way that shows I care. I don’t use mean or bad words that could hurt someone’s feelings. I respect what other people think and try to agree with them. I love learning new things and finding out what’s possible. I ask questions to understand the world better and learn more. I listen carefully to what others say and share my own thoughts and experiences. I’m always ready to try new things.I like to share my thoughts in new and fun ways. I talk in a fun and exciting way that gets people’s attention. I like to use different words and compare things to explain my ideas. I also use jokes to make my talk more fun and interesting.
