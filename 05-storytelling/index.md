The bachelor's thesis discusses Czech photographers who specialize in commercial photography. The thesis analyzes current commercial photography and partially demonstrates how it has evolved to its present form. I have selected photographers through which I can showcase the techniques and styles they use in their work. The thesis integrates theoretical and practical aspects.

The theoretical chapter begins with an introduction to the commercial world and a brief overview of how the commercial photography world has evolved and reached its current state. In each historical period, I identify who was successful during that time. I delve into how one can establish themselves in photography today and what is different compared to the past when commercial photography was at its peak. There is also a mention of today's technology, such as artificial intelligence, which is increasingly making its mark in this field of photography. Subsequently, the thesis examines the style and signature of contemporary photographers, along with a discussion of how and why photographers capture images in this manner and choose this specific style. The thesis primarily focuses on portrait photographers and brings the reader closer to this world that surrounds us every day. 

In the practical part, I utilized the techniques, style, and signature of individual photographers. With these elements, I captured photographs that are inspired by the style and signature described in the theoretical part.
