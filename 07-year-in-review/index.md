# Year in Review

This year has been a significant one for me. It all began when the administration of VŠKK suggested that I attend their institution. I had been tasked with photographing the diploma ceremony for this school, and it was during this event that the seeds of my academic journey were sown. The management mentioned the possibility of completing the course in a single year, but they warned me that it would be challenging. The term ‘a little bit’ was used to describe the difficulty level, but in reality, it was far from ‘a little bit’. It was, in fact, quite a formidable task.
For the past four years, I’ve been working as a photographer for Reporter magazine while also undertaking assignments for various companies. Balancing these professional commitments with my academic responsibilities at VŠKK has proven to be more complex than I initially anticipated. However, I’ve managed to navigate this intricate journey so far, and surprisingly, I’ve found myself relishing the final few months of school. I’m acutely aware that once this phase concludes, I’ll be thrust into the ‘real world’, where adults grapple with daily work routines.
Despite the demanding days, I’ve managed to carve out moments for leisure. One of my favorite stress-busters is taking my motocross bike out for a spin. These rides provide a much-needed respite and help me maintain my equilibrium during this hectic period. Currently, I’m in the eye of the storm, with the tranquility set to be disrupted by the impending onslaught of exams and final papers for all my subjects. The number of subjects is not insignificant, adding to the intensity of the storm. But I’m prepared to face it head-on, armed with the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired over the year.
