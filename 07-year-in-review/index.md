# Year in Review

So. This is my year.
This year started with the administration of the VSCC telling me to go to this school. 
I took pictures for this school of the diploma ceremony and everything started here where the management told me that there is a possibility to go to study this school in one year but it is a little bit difficult. 
A little bit was a little bit concept which is actually not a little bit but a lot difficult. Because I've been shooting for Reporter magazine for 4 years now and shooting for different companies and along with this school it's more complicated than I expected. 
It's a ride I'm managing so far and I'm actually enjoying the last few months of school which will be over and I'll be thrown into real life amongst the adults who work every day.. 
During these hard days I still find moments to go for a ride on my motocross bike and let off some stress. It is at this time that there is a calm before the storm that comes in the form of exams and final papers for all subjects, of which there are not a few.
