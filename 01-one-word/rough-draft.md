## Rough Draft

# Morning

The word "morning" refers to the early part of the day, typically from sunrise until noon. It is a time associated with the start of a new day, a fresh beginning, and the awakening of the world from the darkness of night. Morning is often characterized by the soft light of dawn, the chirping of birds, and a sense of calm and quiet. For many people, morning is a time for routines such as breakfast, preparing for the day ahead, and setting a positive tone for the hours to come. The word "morning" can evoke a range of emotions and experiences, from the peaceful solitude of a sunrise to the hustle and bustle of a busy day's start.
