# Morning

Some individuals wake up with a smile on their faces and full of energy, but for many of us, getting up in the early hours is a real challenge. This essay will focus on several key reasons why some people don't like mornings.

The first reason why some of us don't favor early mornings is a lack of sleep. Modern lifestyles and busy daily schedules often involve late nights and early starts. A lack of quality sleep significantly affects our mood and energy levels, and if a person doesn't have enough time for rest, they can feel tired and indecisive in the morning. Therefore, it's understandable that early hours are not a favorite time of day for many people.

The second reason why many people don't like mornings is the stress of preparing for the upcoming workday. Mornings often involve various tasks and responsibilities, such as preparing breakfast, getting dressed, packing for school or work, and dealing with other everyday concerns. All of this can be stressful and often requires a lot of time and effort. This stress can create negative associations with early mornings.

Another factor that can contribute to an unfavorable relationship with mornings is one's biological rhythm. People have different circadian rhythms, meaning some are natural night owls and have more energy later in the evening, while others are early birds and prefer earlier starts to the day. When the biological rhythm doesn't align with the early wake-up call, it can lead to reluctance and discomfort when getting up.

Even though some people may enjoy mornings and use this part of the day as a time for productivity and serenity, for many of us, the early wake-up time is a challenging task. Understanding the reasons why we may like mornings less than other times of the day can help us find strategies to cope with this part of the day and make it more enjoyable.
